# Landing-Page
Making a basic landing page using the HTML & CSS knowledge I have at this point.

The Project: 
had two design images to use as a guide.
    - first was of the website
    - second was of the colours, fonts, etc. to use

on later visit. Fix blank spacing and buttons and banners not aligned properly
