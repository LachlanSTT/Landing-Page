# Landing-Page
Making a basic landing page using the HTML & CSS knowledge I have at this point.

The Project: 
had two design images to use as a guide.
    - first was of the website
    - second was of the colours, fonts, etc. to use

on later visit. Fix blank spacing and buttons and banners not aligned properly, footer size issues.

Potentially also add images, links and personalise website a bit more
